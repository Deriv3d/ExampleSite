<h1 style="text-align: center;">Hello! My name is Ezrah Marasigan, and these are my favorite National Parks!</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;">If you're planning on going to any of these parks, here are some of my recommendations! </p>

# 1. Yosemite National Park

Yosemite National Park is known mostly for its famous "Yosemite Valley View", however, the valley is only less than 1% of the park!

## Vernal Falls

A great waterfall to go to in the valley would be Vernal Falls. Even though the hike is pretty strenuous, the view at the end is incredibly gorgeous! Once you get to the top, the falls start spraying you with mist, and on a hot day, it feels like you're taking a refreshing shower!

## Mariposa Grove

Mariposa Grove is in the southernmost point of Yosemite, and the giant sequoia trees make you feel like a tiny ant!

# 2. Yellowstone National Park

Next up is the first National Park ever made, founded in 1872 by President Ulysses S. Grant! The United States has about 60% of the whole world's geysers, and all of them are housed within this territory!

## Upper Falls of the Yellowstone River

If you travel up to the Upper Falls of Yellowstone, you'll be greeted by an incredible view of a huge river canyon. There are several lookouts such as Uncle Tom's Lookout, the South Ridge Trail, and the Chittenden Bridge to view the beautiful scenery.
