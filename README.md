<h1 style="text-align: center;">Hello! My name is Ezrah Marasigan, and these are my favorite places to visit in these National Parks!</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;">If you're planning on going to any of these parks, here are some of my recommendations! </p>

# 1. Yosemite National Park

Yosemite National Park is known mostly for its famous "Yosemite Valley View", however, the valley is only less than 1% of the park!

## Vernal Falls

A great waterfall to go to in the valley would be Vernal Falls. Even though the hike is pretty strenuous, the view at the end is incredibly gorgeous! Once you get to the top, the falls start spraying you with mist, and on a hot day, it feels like you're taking a refreshing shower!
<br>
## Mariposa Grove

Mariposa Grove is in the southernmost point of Yosemite, and the giant sequoia trees make you feel like a tiny ant!

# 2. Yellowstone National Park

Next up is the first National Park ever made, founded in 1872 by President Ulysses S. Grant! The United States has about 60% of the whole world's geysers, and all of them are housed within this territory!
<br>
## Upper Falls of the Yellowstone River

If you travel up to the Upper Falls of Yellowstone, you'll be greeted by an incredible view of a huge river canyon. There are several lookouts such as Uncle Tom's Lookout, the South Ridge Trail, and the Chittenden Bridge to view the beautiful scenery.
## Old Faithful
Bearing the signature image of Yellowstone is the Old Faithful geyser, which rose to fame due to its very predictable eruption times. The geyser can blast up to 106-184 feet tall!
<br>
<br>
# 3. Zion National Park
Zion's towering peaks and sandstone cliffs will surely fill you with awe when you first come across them.
<br>
## Angels Landing

To hike up to Angels Landing in Zion is no small feat. First, you're going to have to get a permit, and even if you do get it, the 5.4 mile round-trip hike spanning about 1,488 feet in elevation is no joke. If you're afraid of heights, definitely don't try this! However, if you want to see one of the best views of Zion National Park from above, this trail is for you.
<br>
## Mount Whitney
On the hike up to Mount Whitney, there is a place where you can see both the Moon set in the West and the Sun rise in the East at the exact same time. If you manage to hike up early enough, this is a sight that you'll never forget!
<br>

<p style="text-align: center;"> And that's all! These are the "big three" of my favorite National Parks. Hopefully you learned something, and perhaps you may want to go to some of these places in the near future! </p>
